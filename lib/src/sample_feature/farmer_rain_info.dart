One effective approach involves constructing catchment basins or contour trenches to capture and direct rainwater into the soil, allowing it to seep into the aquifers. Additionally, implementing cover cropping and reduced tillage practices can improve soil structure, enhancing its ability to absorb and retain water, ultimately contributing to groundwater replenishment. Combining these techniques with responsible water management can help ensure a resilient and sustainable water supply for farming operations.'),),
