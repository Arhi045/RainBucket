Groundwater is contained in generally thin terrace deposits and in fractures in the underlying Franciscan Assemblage rocks. The lack of a large storage volume in these aquifer materials limits the available water supply and subjects this area to water supply problems during successive dry years. Continued growth in areas of limited groundwater that also depends on groundwater can present supply problems to existing wells. In addition, the proximity of this basin to the ocean has lead to problems with saltwater intrusion (4.5-26).  \nSource:  1-057_7a_SonomaCountyGP2020Draft EIR_sec4-05.pdf  pg. 4.5-26, 4.5-55, 4.5-56",

        "Subsidence Comments": "1) Throughout the late 1800s and into the 1920s when two thirds of the Santa Clara Valley had been irrigated, water flowed freely from wells. Water-level declines of more than 200 ft occurred in the Santa Clara Valley from the early 1900's to the mid 1960's (Fowler, 1981). Land subsidence was first detected in 1933 (Poland and Ireland, 1988). As the decades passed, groundwater levels continued to decline and spirit-level surveys in 1967 identified subsidence of substantial magnitude as much as 8 feet. \n\nSource: 2-9.02_7b_LandSubsidenceintheSantaClaraValley (web site)",

The cyclic variability in the daily land surface position in the lateral and vertical directions for CUHS indicated the aquifer sediments in the area had experienced elastic deformation. However, a longer-term downward trend likely represents inelastic deformation and indicates reduced storage capacity in the aquifer sediments. In 2011, motion in all the directions increased substantially and corresponded to compression of the aquifer sediments. The cyclic variation in the position of the land surface at CUHS also correlated with water-level measurements in nearby wells, which supports the conclusion that elastic deformation was caused by groundwater withdrawals.\nSource: 3-013_7b_GeologyWaterQualityHydrologyandGeomechanicsCuyamaValleyCA2008SIR2013-5108.pdf\n\n3) Continuous GPS site in Cuyama Valley that shows recent subsidence (Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center)\nSource: Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center. \nSource: 3-013_7b_SOPACWebsite\n\n2015 County of San Luis Obispo Sustainable GW Proposal - Attachment 2\nSource: 3-013_7b_2015CountyofSanLuisObispoSustainableGroundwaterProposalAtt2BasinConditions.pdf",

More recently, samples with chloride concentrations greater than 1,000 mg/l taken from coastal wells have confirmed the presence of seawater intrusion. Groundwater pumping within the Santa Barbara Groundwater Basin has been required at much reduced levels compared to 1991. Effective pumping practices, together with groundwater injection programs have restored the previously existing gradient thereby reversing the trend of seawater intrusion.\nSource:  3-017_7a_SantaBarbaraCoGWReport-2011.pdf pg. 39",

During this period, however, annual groundwater pumping averaged only approximately 3,600 afy, which is approximately 20 to 30 percent less than the previous estimates of basin yield that range between 4,500 to 5,000 afy. The observation that water levels gradually declined under these conditions of recharge and pumping suggests that previous estimates of basin yield may have been overestimated. The results of the change in groundwater storage calculations are summarized below:\nFall 1984 through Fall 1991: 15,988 acre-feet of storage depletion;\nFall 1991 through Spring 1998: 17,661 acre-feet storage increase;\nSpring 1998 through Fall 2008: 5,879 acre-feet of storage depletion.\nSource:  3-018_7a_06-0125_TechMemo_Task1_20120221.pdf  pg 9-10",

Groundwater levels have generally been declining for periods of several decades in the Oxnard Plain and Pleasant Valley basins. While the factors causing declining groundwater trends may have varied among these two basins, long-term replenishment rates have not kept up with long-term withdrawal rates in either of them. Thus, these basins are considered by the District to be in a condition of long-term overdraft.\nSource: 4-004.02_7a_2016GWConditionsReportFINAL.pdf  pg. 12",
        "Subsidence Comments": "1)  Water-level declines in the basin have induced land subsidence that was first measured in 1939 and have resulted in as much as 2.7 feet land subsidence in the southern part of the Oxnard Plain. The model simulated a total of 3 feet of land subsidence in the southern part of the Oxnard Plain and as much as 5 feet in the Las Posas Valley subbasins. Model simulations indicate that most of the land subsidence occurred after the drought of the late 1920s and during the agricultural expansion of the 1950s and 1960s. The results also indicate that subsidence occurred primarily in the upper-aquifer system prior to 1959, but in the lower-aquifer system between 1959-93 owing to an increase in pumpage from the lower-aquifer system. \n\n\"groundwater and oil and gas production are probably major causes in the Oxnard Plain subbasin, and tectonic activity is probably a minor cause (Hanson et al., 2003)\" Subsidence has been documented in the Oxnard Plain:                                                     Source: 4-004.02_7b_SimulationofgroundwaterSurfaceWaterFlowinSantaClara-CalleguarsBasinVenturaCountyWIR02-4136CaPDF",

Rising groundwater levels in the Las Posas Valley are a result of active management to increase groundwater recharge beneath the Arroyo Las Posas. Seawater intrusion began in the Oxnard Plain area by 1930s and was widespread as early as the 1940s. Changes in groundwater management, including pumping reductions, shifting of pumping locations, construction of the Freeman Diversion, and the operation of the Pumping Trough and Pleasant Valley pipeline systems have significantly reduced seawater intrusion, but seawater intrusion conditions persist.\nSource:  4-004.03_7a_CentralCoastGWReport-Aug2014.pdf  pg. 1",

The model simulated a total of 3 feet of land subsidence in the southern part of the Oxnard Plain and as much as 5 feet in the Las Posas Valley subbasins. Model simulations indicate that most of the land subsidence occurred after the drought of the late 1920s and during the agricultural expansion of the 1950s and 1960s. The results also indicate that subsidence occurred primarily in the upper-aquifer system prior to 1959, but in the lower-aquifer system between 1959-93 owing to an increase in pumpage from the lower-aquifer system.\n \nSource: 4-004.03_7b_SimulationofgroundwaterSurfaceWaterFlowinSantaClara-CalleguarsBasinVenturaCountyWIR02-4136CaPDF\n\n2) Continuous GPS site in the basin (VNCO in Ventura) showing recent subsidence\nSource: 4-004.03_7b_GPSStationVNCOwww.UNAVCO.org\n\n3) Ventura County predicts potential subsidence may be occuring, but has not investigated - County site, 2013 Ventura County General Plan - Hazards Appendix\nSource: Source: 4-004.03_7b_2013_VenturaCountyGeneral_Plan_Hazards_Appendix.pdf",

Data collected from a horizontal extensometer, surveying, electronic distance measurements, tiltmeters, heat dissipation sensors, and tripod mounted LIDAR scans will be employed to evaluate the cause of the fissures and their relation to desiccation cracks, and perhaps to provide real-time monitoring of fissure hazards (Densmore, et al., 2010).\nSource: 6-025_7a_MEDCOM_SEA_Draft_Final.pdf  pg 3-5",

Nevertheless, the District annually reviews Surveyor data to evaluate ground surface fluctuations within the District's service area. If irreversible subsidence was found to occur in a localized area in relation to groundwater pumping patterns or groundwater storage conditions, OCWD would coordinate with local officials to investigate and develop an approach to address the subsidence.\"   OCWD also avoids exceeding the safe yield to reduce the chances of inelastic subsidence.\n\nReal time monitoring network \"consists of continuously operating GPS reference stations that monitor horizontal and vertical movement throughout Orange County.\"  \"GPS data collected by the Surveyor over the past 12 years (2002-2014) show that the ground surface fluctuations appear to be completely elastic, reversible, and well correlated with fluctuations in groundwater levels.  The \"data indicate that there has NOT been any permanent, irreversible subsidence of the ground surface over the past 12 years.\"\n\nSubsidence began as early as 1898; groundwater storage conditions were at historical lows in the late 1950s.  \"More recent data show a consistent pattern of the ground surface rising and falling in tandem with groundwater levels and overall changes in basin groundwater storage.\"\nSource: Orange County Water District Groundwater Management Plan 2015 Update:\n8-001_7b_groundwatermanagementplan2015update_20150624.pdf",
